# KTester
This is the offical repository for the paper "Knowledge Matters: Injecting Project and Testing Knowledge into LLM-based Unit Test Generation".

## Overview
The file structure of the repository is as follows:
```
KTester
|—— code: The source code of KTester.
|    |—— Java
|    |    |—— project-index-builder
|    |    └—— project-info-process
|    |—— procedure
|    |—— templates
|    |—— tools
|    |—— settings.py
|    |—— preparation.py: code for work space preparation and project knowledge building.
|    |—— generate_unit_test.py: generate unit test class for focal methods.
|    └—— evaluation.py: code for running evaluations in paper.
|—— data: 
|    |—— dataset_info.json: Basic infomation of evaluation dataset, including projects, target classs, focal methods and file paths.
|    └—— project_index: Knowledge extracted from projects in dataset.
└—— Readme.md
```

## Preparation
Environment for our experiments:
- Java: openjdk 17.0.12 2024-07-16
- Python: 3.13.0
- Maven: Apache Maven 3.9.9 

## Running
0. set JVM language to English:
```sh
setx _JAVA_OPTIONS "-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
```
1. Download the [dataset](#dataset-and-evaluation-results).
2. Rename `code/settings.py.template` to `code/settings.py` and compelete settings.
3. Run the following commands:
```sh
cd code
# prepare workspace
python preparation.py -W
# extract project knowledges
python preparation.py -P
# generate unit tests
python generate_unit_test.py
# run unit test and get coverage
python evaluation.py --operation coverage
# collect baseline results:
python evaluation.py --operation baseline
```
In addition, we provide the parameter `-F <log file path>` to generate logs for the entire process.

## Dataset and Evaluation Results
The full dataset can be downloaded [this link.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nB2CaqwQPWkXCf6riOPDfDbQ82LY2Yky?usp=drive_link)
It contains 3 zip files:
1. projects: Maven Java projetcs used in the dataset.
2. project_lucene: Function level indexes, to construct prompts for the focal method, you should unzip this file to `./data/project_index/lucene`
3. evaluation_results: It contains prompts, test classes generated by KTester and coverage reports
