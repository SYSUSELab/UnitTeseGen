You are a professional who writes Java test methods. Your task is to write a test method for a specific method within a target class, using JUnit5 and Mockito libraries. 

Please follow these steps:
1. Review the focused method to understand its functionality and possible input combinations and output values.
2. Write a test method for the focused method that considers possible input combinations and includes test cases for each condition.
3. Ensure the test method follows the structure of the existing test class.
4. The test method should be easy for other programmers to understand.

The details are as follows:

@input{focused method}
```Java
{{ focused_method }}
```

@input{target class}
```Java
{{ target_class }}
```

@input{existing test class}
```Java
<initial_class>
```
