You are a professional software tester. Write a **JUnit 5** test class using **Mockito** library for a focal method in a target class.

**Instructions:**

1. Understand the focal method's behavior.
2. Identify all exception-throwing scenarios, and design test cases to cover them.
3. Follow the structure of the existing test class, and write test methods for uncovered exception scenarios.
4. Reinitialize variables in a `@BeforeEach` method if necessary.

**Requirements:**

- Use descriptive test method names and meaningful comments.
- Do not access private methods or fields of target class and dependent class directly. **If the focal method is private, try to use reflection to access it.**
- Include all necessary imports; ensure the code is syntactically correct.

The details are as follows:

@input{focal method and target class}
Here is the code of focal method, `{{method_name}}`, with the focal class `{{ class_name }}`:
```Java
{{ class_code }}
```

@input{existing test class}
```Java
<initial_class>
```

{% if context_dict | length > 0 %}
@input{context information}
{% for key, value in context_dict.items() %}
{{ key }}: 
{{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

@output{test class}: output the code wrapped in a Markdown code block ```java at the beginning and ``` at the end.
