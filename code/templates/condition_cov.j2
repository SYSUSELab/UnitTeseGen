As a professional Java software testing expert, your task is to generate high-quality unit test code for a focal method, using JUnit5 and Mockito libraries. 

You'll be provided with the following information:
1. The focal method that needs testing.
2. Basic information of the target class to which the focus method belongs, including fields and methods.
3. The structure of the existing test class, including @Before/@After functions.
4. Any context information necessary for generating tests.

Please ensure the unit test code you generate meets these requirements:

Test Coverage Requirements:
- Generate test cases to cover all condition branches in the target method.
Code Quality Requirements:
- Use clear and descriptive test method names.
- Add detailed comments explaining test scenarios.
- Make the test code easy to understand and maintain.
- Do not directly invoke any private methods or fields of the target class and dependent class. **If the focal method is private, try to use reflection to access it.**
- Add necessary import statements and ensure there are no syntax errors in the generated code.

Test Structure:
- Follow the existing test class, using the appropriate test frameworks and assertions, without modifying @Before and @After functions.
- If the variables initialized in @Setup do not match the scenario to be tested, reinitialize them within the test function.
- Properly set up test fixtures and dependencies.
- Divide test cases into different functions logically.
- Consider merging multiple test cases into parameterized tests, if possible.

@input{focused method and target class}
Here is the code of focal method, `{{method_name}}`, with the focal class `{{ class_name }}`:
```Java
{{ class_code }}
```

@input{existing test class}
```Java
<initial_class>
```

{% if context_dict | length > 0 %}
@input{context information}
{% for key, value in context_dict.items() %}
{{ key }}: 
{{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

@output{test class}: output the code wrapped in a Markdown code block ```java at the beginning and ``` at the end.
