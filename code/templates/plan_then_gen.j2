You are a professional software tester. Your task is to develop a test plan for a focused method within a target class, and then write a test class based on that test plan using **JUnit5** and **Mockito** libraries.

Please follow these instructions:

1. Review the focused method and understand its functionality.
2. Develop a test plan outlining the requirements to be tested. The test plan should be clear and easy for other programmers to understand.
3. Each test function within the test class should meet a requirement specified in the test plan.
4. The test class should follow the existing test class structure and utilize JUnit5 and Mockito libraries.
5. Ensure the test class includes `@BeforeEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterEach`, and `@AfterAll` annotations where appropriate.

The details are as follows:

@input{focused method and target class}
Here is the code of focal method, `{{method_name}}`, with the focal class `{{ class_name }}`:
```Java
{{ class_code }}
```

@input{existing test class}
```Java
<initial_class>
```

Please start by providing a detailed test plan for the focused method.
Once the test plan is confirmed, proceed to create a complete test class based on the plan.
