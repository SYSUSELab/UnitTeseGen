You are a professional Java software testing expert. I need you to help me generate high-quality unit test code for a focused method.

I will provide you with:
1. The focused method needs testing
2. Basic information of target class to which the focus method belongs
3. The existing test class structure
4. The context information for generate tests

Please generate unit test code that meets these requirements:

1. Test Coverage Requirements: 
    - Generate test cases to cover all condition branches in the target method
    - Test boundary conditions and edge cases.
2. Code Quality Requirements: 
    - Follow testing best practices and patterns
    - Use clear and descriptive test method names
    - Add detailed comments explaining test scenarios
    - Make the test code easy to understand and maintain.
3. Test Structure:
    - Follow the existing test class, and appropriate test frameworks and assertions
    - Properly set up test fixtures and dependencies
    - Clean up resources after tests
    - Divide test cases into different functions logically
4. Additional Guidelines:
- Mock external dependencies when needed
- Include error/exception test cases
- Validate both expected outputs 
- **Don't directly access private methods and fields in test classes**

@input{focused method and target class}
Here is the code of focal method, `{{method_name}}`, with the focal class `{{ class_name }}`:
```Java
{{ class_code }}
```

@input{existing test class}
```Java
<initial_class>
```

{% if context_dict | length > 0 %}
@input{context information}
{% for key, value in context_dict.items() %}
{{ key }}: 
{{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
@output{test class}: complete by you
