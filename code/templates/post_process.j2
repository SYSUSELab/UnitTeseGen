{% if compilation %}
You are an experienced Java developer tasked with fixing a piece of code that contains compilation errors. Your task is to resolve these issues after analyzing the code and its compilation feedback.

Use the following steps to guide your analysis and correction process:
1. Review the provided Java code for any syntactical or logical errors.
2. Analyze the compilation feedback to understand the specific errors and their locations within the code.
3. Apply necessary corrections to the code based on the feedback, and output the compelete correct code.
The Java code you need to fix is provided below:
```java
{{ code_to_fix }}
```

Corresponding compilation feedback:
```
{{ feedback }}
```

And you can use the following related information to assist you in your analysis and correction:
```
{{ context_dict }}
```

**Note**: If the method-to-test in the @Test function is a private method, you can use **reflection** to call it.

Now you should output the corrected Java code wrapped in a Markdown code block ```java at the beginning and ``` at the end: 
{% endif %}
